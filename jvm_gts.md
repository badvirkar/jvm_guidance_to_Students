Author : Sadguru Shri Wamanrao Pai

```
ll Jai Jeevan Vidya ll
PREFACE
It gives us great pleasure to present this small
```
“Jeevan Vidya’s Guidance to Students” for the benefit

of readers. Sadguru Wamanrao Pai has authored this

book especially for children (and also useful for their

parents & teachers). He has an important objective in

mind in writing this book. The children of today are the

citizens of tomorrow and the future of our nation

depends completely on them. If we observe closely, we

will realise that the students of today are highly

intelligent. However, if such clever students do not get

correct guidance, their life is likely to be ruined, and as

a consequence, the welfare and progress of the nation

will be in danger. Sadguru Shri Wamanrao Pai, who has

retired as a Deputy Secretary, Government of

Maharashtra, has completely devoted himself, through

the medium of discourses, for the eradication of the

ignorance, superstitions, fatalism and negative think-

ing of the people so that they can blossom their lives

with happiness, peace, success and prosperity. The

twin objectives of Sadguru are that, “The world should

become a happy place and our nation should surpass

every other nation in the world in terms of material

development and psycho-spiritual progress.” For

achievening this purpose he has evolved Jeevan Vidya

philosophy which revolves around the divine message,

“You are the Architect of Your Destiny”. The present

book is being published with the intention that the

guidance of Sadguru should become available to stu-

dents so that they become excellent citizens of our

nation and take it along the path of all-round progress

and fulfil the two goals mentioned above.


....................................................................................................................

The book has been written by Sadguru keeping in

mind the various questions asked by students from

time to time. Sadguru expects that students will study

the book again and again, understand the teachings

given therein and bring about their own wellbeing and

welfare and also that of the society and the nation.

Similarly, parents and teachers too should read the

book and sincerely try to impress upon the minds of

the students the teachings of Sadguru. This is the sole

objective behind the publication of this book. Sadguru

has been doing the work of guiding the common man,

without a break and without any expectation for the

last 48 years. He neither takes any honorarium for his

discourses nor does he accept any royalty for the books

authored by him nor does he take any Guru-dakshina

from his disciples. In the same way, the Namdharaks

(activists) of Jeevan Vidya Mission work like their

Sadguru for his cause without charging any commis-

sion. We have, so far, published a number of books

authored by Sadguru and they have all become very

popular. It is only because of this fact that so many

editions of the books have had to be published. We

humbly expect that this small book will also be wel-

comed whole-heartedly by the people. Despite the high

cost of publishing, we have kept the price of this book

very low.

We place on record our sincere thanks to Shri Ajit

M. Ingle who has translated this book into English. We

are also grateful to all those who have extended full

co-operation and assistance for the publication of this

book.

Divine Message
“You are the architect of your own life”
```
```
Divine Teaching
The royal road to the kingdom of peace and bliss
is ‘Wistom’. The good and evil actions that you
direct towards others, positively boomerang on
you sooner or later. ‘Wisdom’ therefore lies in
leading your life constantly bearing in mind this
eternal truth.
```

....................................................................................................................

## Jeevan Vidyaís Guidance to Students

```
Q. 1 What exactly is meant by education?
Please guide us on this subject.
```
```
Ans. In Manís life, knowledge is supreme.
There is nothing as sacred, auspicious
and useful as knowledge. The effort
made by Man to acquire knowledge is
called education. Manís education starts
in the motherís womb and continues till
he reaches his tomb; in other words,
Man is an eternal student and must
keep studying from the cradle to the
grave. Hence, Jeevan Vidya says that,
ìEducation involves studying during
every moment of oneís existenceíí. If
Man does not possess knowledge or
education, he is nothing better than a
two-legged animal! Unfortunately, the
number of two-legged animals among
human beings is only increasing
tremendously day by day. Many people
have started considering money to be
God and are madly running after it,
while at the same time turning their
backs on knowledge which is essential
for acquiring wisdom. The main reason
why there is so little happiness in the
world and so much sorrow is that
```

....................................................................................................................

```
people have over-emphasized the
importance of money and turned their
backs on knowledge. In short, there is
no alternative to knowledge in the world
and, therefore, Jeevan Vidya stresses
that :
```
```
ëKnowledge is weapon, protector and science,
Knowledge is strength, power and force,
Knowledge is an asset, riches and wealth,
Knowledge is God, Angel and Divinity,
So, become great by acquiring knowledge and
wisdomí.
```
Q. 2 Do you think that our knowledge can

```
be evaluated adequately by means of
a written test that lasts for only three
hours?
```
Ans. It is possible that studentsí knowledge

```
can be evaluated adequately by means
of a written test that lasts for only three
hours. In this context a Marathi saying
would be very apt, namely, ìOne can
judge whether rice has been properly
cooked by testing just one grainî.
Keeping this in mind, one can say that
studentsí knowledge can be evaluated
adequately by means of a written test
that lasts for only three hours. Further,
the knowledge contained in every
```

....................................................................................................................

```
subject is so vast that it may not be
possible to ask more questions and carry
out a complete evaluation of students
due to lack of time.
```
Q. 3 How should one study?

Ans. Most students do not know the

```
technique of studying. Many a times,
students erroneously believe that just
reading a book means studying it. There
are certain specific methods of studying.
These techniques have been given
below in brief: -
```
```
1) Jeevan Vidya has laid down a 3 R
formula for studying, viz. Read,
Remember and Reproduce as per
which a student must :
```
i) read again and again;

```
ii) memorize whatever has been
read; and
```
```
iii) reproduce, whatever has been
memorized, on paper.
```
This is called studying.

```
2) A lesson consists of paragraphs.
After reading the paragraph a few
times, the student must make a
summary of the paragraph. If the
```

....................................................................................................................

```
paragraph consists of ten to twelve
lines then the summary should
consist of three to four lines. If the
student studies in this manner, he
will find the summary very useful for
revision while preparing for the
annual exami-nations.
```
```
3) The student must go to school only
after first reading the chapter or
lesson that the teacher would be
teaching in school on that day. When
the teacher teaches that lesson in
school, the student must pay
complete attention to what is being
taught. After returning home, the
student must read again the lesson
taught by the teacher in school. By
studying in this way, the student
revises the lesson three times. Both
teachers and students have a
responsibility to ensure that this
method is adopted. The teacher must
always tell the students what he
proposes to teach the next day while
the students must also request the
teacher to tell them which lesson is
going to teach them the next day.
```
4) An excellent method of studying is


....................................................................................................................

```
to ìlearn in the process of teachingî.
If the student makes efforts to teach
other students in his class who need
help, he would be benefited in two
ways. On the one hand he would
learn well and on the other he would
earn the credit of having taught other
students in the class. One has to
understand well before teaching
others. The main reason for this is
that, one cannot teach a subject to
others unless one has understood it
well.
```
```
5) The fifth method of studying is
somewhat different from other types.
As per this method, two or more
students must first study the topic
at home, then gather in the house of
one of the students. The students
must discus the topic that they have
learnt and test each otherís
knowledge by asking each other
questions on it. By studying in this
manner, students can obtain
excellent success. In short, to study
means to reread samething again
and again, i.e. revision. Therefore,
Jeevan Vidya says,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
ìThere is no vision without
revisionî
```
```
Students must keep this principle of
Jeevan Vidya in mind and never
ignore revision.
```
Q. 4 How must one keep the mind in a

good mood for studying?

Ans. While studying, every student must

```
always remember the fact that by
studying he is not doing favour to his
parents or his teachers. ëStudyingí is the
primary responsibility and duty of every
student. The student who does not fulfill
this duty becomes a criminal in the court
of God. Actually, studying does not
involve doing too much effort. If a
student cannot study with concentration,
while sitting comfortably under a fan,
he will not be able to do anything at all
in his future life. Further, if a student
studies while he is still in the right age
for studying, he will not find it
troublesome. Every student must
remember the fact that it is not possible
for him to avoid ëstudyingí. If a student
does not take adequate efforts while he
is still in the right age of studying, he
will still have to appear for some
```

....................................................................................................................

```
examination or test in the future, in the
advanced age, where he will be required
to study. The problems of studying are
felt very much as an adult and, therefore,
a student must study wholeheartedly at
the right age. The second most
important point is that the student must
love to study. To achieve this objective,
students should understand the nature
of studying. Studying is not to be done
for its own sake nor is it to be done for
obtaining a lot of marks. The text books
prescribed for students contain excellent
knowledge in them. Studying is to be
done to acquire this knowledge. If the
student studies keeping the importance
of knowledge in mind and studies with
the intention of acquiring knowledge,
he will definitely start liking his studies.
Every student must remember that by
studying he acquires knowledge which
will open many doors to his material
progress, in future. The student must
always keep in mind the truth that he is
studying only for his benefit and material
progress so that he will automatically
start loving studies. This is the sole
method of keeping the mind always in a
good mood for studying.
```

....................................................................................................................

Q. 5. How much time should a student

study? Please guide us in the matter.

Ans. How much time a student should study

```
depends on the grasping capacity of
each student. It may be sufficient for a
bright and intelligent student to study
even for one hour. Conversely, a dull
and less intelligent student may be
required to study for a much longer
time. In this context I am reminded of a
story. Once upon a time there was a
king. He had a hobby of reading and
hearing new poems. For this purpose,
he hit upon a plan. He had an
announcement made in the kingdom
that, ìWhosoever will read a new poem
in my court will get a handsome prize.î
Accordingly, lots of poets started
visiting the kingís court to read out
new poems to him. The king had
gathered ten pundits around himself
who used to sit in a row beside him.
The first pundit was such that once
any poem was read to him, he could
remember it exactly as it was recited
and recite it back. The second pundit
could do the same once the poem was
recited to him twice. In this way, the
other pundits sitting in a row could
```

....................................................................................................................

```
recite a poem provided it was recited
three times, four times, etc till the last
pundit who could recite the poem if
read out to him ten times. As soon as
the poet read out a new poem, the
king used to exclaim, ìThis poem is not
new, as all of us already know this
poem!î Then he would immediately ask
the first pundit to recite the poem. The
pundit would do so easily, since he had
the gift of remembering the poem if
heard only once. Then the king would
say, ìEven the second pundit knows
the poemî and would ask the second
pundit to recite the poem. In this way,
all the ten pundits would recite the
poem one by one. On seeing this, the
poets would go away bemused and
bewildered. What we should realize
from this story is that some people
have the gift of memorizing something
after hearing it once, some after hearing
twice and so on till they hear it ten
times. In other words, some can
remember things on reading or hearing
them once while others have to read or
hear something many times to be able
to memorize it. This fact is applicable
to every student. Every student must,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
therefore, decide how much time he
should study after taking into account
his own capacity. Just as one should
decide how much one should eat,
depending on oneís capacity for
digestion, so is the case with studying.
```
Q. 6. Can students be categorised into

ëcleverí and ëdullí students?

Ans. From the viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya,

```
basically students cannot be
categorised as ëcleverí and ëdullí. Since
the childís birth, various types of
education, teachings and sanskars
(impressions on the mind) are,
knowingly or unknowingly imparted to
children. As explained above, these
education, teachings and sanskars are
imparted by mother, father, brother,
sister, grandmother, grandfather, uncle,
aunt, other relatives, teacher, professor,
neighbours, friends, etc. and they are
responsible for moulding the mind and
the intellect of the students either in
desirable ways or undesirable ways.
Nevertheless, according to Jeevan Vidya
philosophy, it is possible to make a so-
called ëdullí student into a ëbrightí
student provided correct efforts are
```

....................................................................................................................

```
made under proper guidance.
Therefore, Jeevan Vidya reiterates that:
ì The master key to a successful life
lies in accepting the circumstances as
they exist and trying to mould them in
the desired way.î
```
Q. 7. Whether it is necessary for students to

play as well as study?

Ans: There is beautiful saying that, ìAnything

```
in excess is bad!î Though sleeping is
absolutely essential, there is a limit to
how much a person should sleep.
Similarly, eating food is essential but
again there is always be a limit as to
how much one should eat. In the same
way, though it is true that it is absolutely
essential to study, it is definitely wrong
to become a book-worm and be wholly
absorbed in studies to the exclusion of
everything else. In fact there is an apt
saying that ìAll work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy!î All the three things,
namely, studies, play and rest are
important. After studying adequately, it
is necessary to play for some time and
then rest for a few minutes.
```
Q 8. Should children attend private tuition

or classes even though their parents


....................................................................................................................

cannot afford them?

Ans. If the parents are illiterate or are literate

```
but unable to devote any time to the
education of their children due to some
reason or teachers in school do not teach
properly or in the correct way, the only
option left may be to go in for private
tuition or classes. Another alternative
students could be to study whole-
heartedly and obtain the guidance of
clever students whenever necessary.
```
Q 9. Some parents insist that their children

```
must always obtain first rank in class,
is this insistence proper?
```
Ans. Almost all parents whole-heartedly

```
desire that their children should obtain
first rank in class, in fact, there is nothing
wrong in thinking along these lines. But
parents should realize that this may not
be possible in practice. Since there is
only one first rank, obviously all the
students cannot obtain it. According to
the view-point of Jeevan Vidya, students
must study to acquire knowledge and
not to get highest marks and rank first
in class. In other words, students must
be knowledge-oriented and not marks-
oriented since this would prove to be
```

....................................................................................................................

```
very useful for their future. When
students study with the intention of
obtaining knowledge, the students not
only manage to acquire knowledge but
they are also likely to get excellent marks
in the examinations. The student who
studies with the intention of acquiring
knowledge, will never fear examinations.
Instead, he is ever ready to answer any
question posed to him on the strength
of his knowledge. Therefore, Jeevan
Vidya emphasizes,
ìKnowledge is God, Ignorance is Devilî
Secondly, our parents give birth to us
and look after us in every way till we
learn to stand on our own feet. In return
for this service, our parents do not
expect any compensation from us.
Nevertheless, it is the duty of every
student to make them happy in return
for all the benefits that parents shower
on him. All parents whole-heartedly
desire that their children should go to
schools and colleges and study well,
get good marks and gain excellent
success in the examinations. It is difficult
to describe the joy that parents
experience when their children study
well and obtain excellent success in the
```

....................................................................................................................

```
examinations. Students should always
remember that, those students who give
such joy to their parents obtain their
blessings and these blessings in turn
help the students to gain happiness,
peace, contentment, success and
prosperity in future,
```
Q. 10 Should students watch Television (TV),

movies, plays, etc. for entertainment?

Ans. I have already answered this in the

```
earlier question. All three things,
namely, study, play and rest are
necessary for students. After having
studied adequately, there is no harm if
a student watches TV or perhaps even
a play or a movie. However, under no
circumstances should the student sit in
front of the idiot box (TV) for hours like
a couch potato since this is an invitation
to a number of evils. Sitting constantly
in front of the TV for hours gives rise to
diseases like piles, sooner or later.
Similarly, watching TV continuously will
lead to eyesight getting damaged and
resultant visits to the Doctor. In the
same way, on hearing constantly the
noise generated by TV, the students
hearing power will also be affected.
```

....................................................................................................................

```
Thus, sitting in front of the TV
constantly will definitely harm the health
of the student, sooner or later, and the
result will be that he will completely
ignore studies and he will have to face
failure in the examinations; one does
not need an astrologer to predict the
fate of such a student.
```
Q 11. Should students take part in extra

```
curricular activities? (e.g. various
competitions, dramas, sports, National
Cadet Corps (NCC), etc.)
```
Ans. Students must always remember that

```
they go to school or college primarily to
study. Students who study adequately
are likely to find it very difficult to also
take part in extra curricular activities,
since they will not have enough stamina
to do both simultaneously. Therefore,
from the viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya,
those students who wish to make a
career through the medium of studies
should not involve themselves in extra
curricular activities.
```
Q 12. Should students participate in school

or college picnics?

Ans. Whether students should participate in


....................................................................................................................

```
school or college picnics depends
entirely on the prevailing circumstances.
The decision whether to participate in
the school or college picnic would have
to be taken after taking into account the
qualities of the teacher or professor who
is organising the same. A common
experience is that frequently good
children fall prey to various addictions
and bad habits during such picnics. The
nature of the mind is such that it is
easily attracted by undesirable things,
just as water always flows downwards
easily. If it is observed that some of the
students or teachers or professors are
addicted to vices or have an undesirable
nature, it is quite probable that these
people will influence good children
negatively so that they may become
addicted to various vices. This is
especially true of timid children who
can be easily influenced by such people;
there are many examples of children
being spoilt in this way. In the same
way, some children initially try out
addictive substances just for fun, but
subsequently, they get trapped by the
tentacles of addiction. Similarly, if some
of the teachers among those going for
```

....................................................................................................................

```
picnics are smokers or are addicted to
alcohol or chew tobacco, etc., it would
not take much time for the children, too,
to become addicted to such things.
Secondly, if the teachers who are taking
the children to the picnic are not good
organisers and do not have proper
control over the students, there is likely
to be lack of control over the bad events
which will occur and there would be a
fear of danger to children. One hears or
reads of a number of unfortunate
incidents of students going to picnics
and having some terrible accidents,
going for a swim and getting drowned,
slipping and falling into valleys, etc.
```
```
Therefore, the decision whether the
children should go for picnics or not will
depend on all these circumstances. The
students and their parents should take
the right decision taking into account
the ground reality explained above.
Similarly, considering the tremendous
responsibility involved in taking students
for picnics, the Principal should pay
personal attention to the matters related
to organising of picnics and should
appoint able and good teachers for the
same.
```

....................................................................................................................

Q. 13. Even after becoming educated, it is

```
difficult to get jobs. Then what is the
need for becoming educated?
```
Ans. The very concept that ëone must

```
become educated so that one can get
jobsí itself is basically erroneous. Since
the demand for jobs is very high due to
the large number of candidates, while
the number of jobs available are limited,
how can everyone get jobs? Besides,
the population is growing day by day
and the unemployment problem is
assuming very serious proportions.
Further, as result of advances in science
and technology, the need to employ
unskilled people is also decreasing day
by day. On the other hand these
changes in technology are creating jobs
for qualified and educated people.
Under such circumstances, it is wrong
to think that students should become
educated merely for getting jobs.
According to the viewpoint of Jeevan
Vidya, one should become educated for
widening and broadening the scope of
oneís mind and intellect. For this
purpose, reading, listening,
contemplation, studying and correct
```

....................................................................................................................

```
guidance are essential. After completing
oneís education, it would be more
appropriate to start some independent
business for oneís livelihood, instead of
looking out for some job. I have
observed that many illiterate people
have been able to earn a lot of money
from business, without having even the
necessary capital initially. If this is so,
then why should literate people be
unable to earn money through an
independent business? Students must
always remember that work is, in fact
a superior form of Yoga, which is useful
to oneself as well as others. Therefore,
students and their parents must take
into account this reality and make plans
about what business the student will
be doing as soon as he completes his
education. There are many fields in
which business can be started.
However, usually, people do not even
think of these various fields but try to
travel the stereotyped path of obtaining
a job. Not only is this tendency harmful
to the students as well as the parents,
but it is also undesirable from the
viewpoint of the material development
and spiritual progress of the nation.
```

....................................................................................................................

```
The other important point that teachers
and students must always remember
is that, neither should teachers teach
the students because it will help them
to obtain their livelihood nor should the
students look at study as a means to
help them fill their stomach. The
principal objective behind teaching and
learning is to impart or ëdonateí
knowledge to them, which will enable
them to become ëexcellent citizens of
the nationí. In other words, students
should go to schools and colleges and
acquire knowledge in various fields
since it will help them to make the
nation prosperous, strong and powerful
and enable the world to become happy
as a result. Both science and
spiritualism are forms of knowledge.
Science is the knowledge of the world,
while spiritualism is the knowledge of
God. With the help of science and
technology, Man can make material
development, while with the help of
spiritualism, Man can attain psycho-
spiritual progress. A nation can
progress in the true sense only if it can
achieve both material development as
well as psycho-spiritual progress. Thus,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
both science and spiritualism are
essential for the nation. In brief, the
importance and necessity of education
in life is tremendous. Education
possesses the amazing power of
making a beast into God! Therefore,
education to be imparted should be
such that it helps Man to earn his
livelihood, and it also enables him to
acquire wisdom.
```
Q. 14. Does God help students in their

studies?

Ans. Students erroneously imagine that God

```
will help them in their studies - He does
not help them in this manner. In fact,
there is a beautiful saying that, ìGod
helps those who help themselves!î God
or nature has granted every student the
blessing of intellect. The more this
intellect is used by the student, the
sharper and brighter he becomes. Just
as a knife get rusted and becomes
useless if it is not used, the intellect
becomes ërustedí if not used and over a
period of time it becomes duller and
duller till it becomes totally useless.
Studying is nothing other than making
use of the intellect. In the same way,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
making efforts again and again is also
studying. Hence Jeevan Vidya
emphasizes that,
```
```
ìEfforts have the potential or capacity
to achieve everything including ëGod-
realizationí and, therefore, efforts may
be considered to be even greater than
God.î
```
Q. 15. Some students indulge in practices like

```
Navas (taking a vow that some
particular thing would be offered to
God if the desired result is obtained),
tying amulets around the wrist, neck,
etc. in the hope that they would pass
examinations. What are your views on
this subject?
```
Ans. To offer a Navas is nothing short of

```
trying to bribe God! We are aware that
frequently, people bribe government /
municipal officials for getting their work
done. A Navas is a similar sort of thing;
the student offering Navas is in effect
saying that, ìOh God! Please pass me
and in return I shall offer you five
kilograms of sweetmeatsí. The whole
practice of offering Navas is nonsensical.
God has never told anyone that, ìPlease
offer Me a Navas and I shall fulfill all
```

....................................................................................................................

```
your desires!î It is only the students or
the parents or the priestly class who
have drawn such imaginary conclusions
and have unnecessarily involved God in
it! If as imagined by the student, he
somehow passes after offering a Navas,
God never ëeatsí any of the sweetmeats
offered to Him. All the sweetmeats are
eaten up only by the people who offered
Navas. In this context, students must
remember a very important fact. The
idol or representation or image of God
to whom the Navas is offered neither
sits down nor stands up nor does it
move nor smile nor walk nor talk; in fact
it does not do anything at all. If this is
so, then how can the idol bless the
student and fulfil his desires of passing
in the examinations? It is not a sign of
wisdom on the part of the student to
expect such an impossible thing to
happen. In short, offering Navas, tying
amulets around the wrist or neck, etc
and such other things is nothing but
different forms of superstitions. Instead
of falling prey to such superstitions and
becoming fatalists, students should have
complete faith in the divine force that
resides within them and tread the path
```

....................................................................................................................

```
of constructive and wholehearted
efforts. Our Sages and Saints have again
and again reiterated that God dwells in
everyone. In this context the following
words of an American philosopher, Dr.
Murphy are worth contemplating:
```
```
ìThe knowledge of a mighty power
within you, which is capable of bringing
to pass all your desires gives you
immense confidence and sense of
peace.î
```
```
In short, students should not become
victims of superstitions and blind faith
but instead always try to have complete
faith in the God that dwells within them.
```
Q. 16 Can students sharpen their intelligence

by taking any medicines?

Ans. It is a wrong notion that students can

```
sharpen their intelligence by taking some
medicines. It is quite possible that on
taking certain medicines, an illusion of
sharper intelligence is created. Let alone
medicines, many people are also under
the erroneous impression that smoking
beedis / cigarettes, drinking alcohol, etc.
helps to sharpen intelligence. However,
students should not become victims of
```

....................................................................................................................

```
addictions in search of such so-called
ëbenefitsí, since they would be only
destroying their future with their own
hands. Intelligence can be sharpened only
by using it properly and not by the use of
medicines.
```
Q. 17 Would it be realistic to consider that

```
our mother, father and teacher are
equivalent to God?
```
Ans. Jeevan Vidya defines God as under:

```
ìGod is someone who gives us
something or some benefitî
```
```
God or nature has granted us this
priceless human body. Besides this, He
has given us subtle, very useful and
wonderful gifts of the five organs of
action, five organs of knowledge, five
pranas (vital energies), internal organs
like mind, intellect, memory, willpower,
etc. In the same way, he has created the
Universe for us to enjoy the festival of joy.
In other words, God has showered us
with his blessings. Man must, therefore,
always be grateful to Him. Similarly, our
mother and father give us so much in our
lives. They give birth to us, they look
after us and care for us, they undergo a
```

....................................................................................................................

```
lot of trouble in bringing us up, educating
us, etc. and also help us to become
independent and stand on our own feet.
Thus, our parents have conferred a lot of
favours on us and it is necessary to
consider them as God. In the same way,
our teachers and professors impart
knowledge to us. In this context, students
must always remember an important
principle of Jeevan Vidya that,
```
```
ìGratitude is Punya (merit), while
ingratitude is Papa (sin)î
```
Similarly, Dr. Murphy says,

```
ìA grateful heart is always close to the
creative forces of the universe causing
countless blessings to flow towards it,
by the law of reciprocal relationship
based on the cosmic law of action and
reaction.î
```
```
In this context the words of an English
author are worthy of contemplation:
```
```
ìThink of all you have to be grateful
for and thank God for all your boons
and bounties.î
```
Q. 18 Should students be ambitious? If so,

```
what should they do to achieve their
ambition?
```

....................................................................................................................

Ans. Every student must be ambitious. The

```
student who is not ambitious is as good
as a corpse, even though he is alive.
However, it is very important to
understand the exact meaning of ëbeing
ambitiousí. Many students believe that
being ambitious means ëto earn lots of
moneyí. Jeevan Vidya does not refer to
this sort of ambition. The students, who
harbour such sort of ambitions, are
motivated to earn money by undesirable
means. The ambition to earn ëlots of
moneyí is responsible for the terrible
ëcancerí of corruption that has engulfed
the nation. Just as a person suffering
from cancer undergoes a lot of suffering
before ultimately succumbing to the
disease, similarly the ëcancer of
corruptioní will ultimately lead to the
ruin of the nation i.e. we will all be
ruined; it does not require an astrologer
to make this prediction. A corrupt
person is also most likely to be a traitor
who will betray the nation for monetary
gains. In fact, corrupt people are traitors
and ëenemy number oneí of the nation.
Therefore, students must always
remember that, instead of harbouring
the ambition of earning ëlots of moneyí,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
students must nurture the ambition of
acquiring a lot of knowledge. Students
must acquire knowledge in various fields
and utilize the knowledge so gained for
bringing about the material development
and psycho-spiritual progress of the
nation. We may conclude that Jeevan
Vidya teaches students to acquire
knowledge with the intention and
ambition of bringing about all-round
progress of the nation.
```
Q. 19 What is the duty of students going to

schools and colleges?

Ans. Indian culture considers Kartavya

```
Dharma i.e. ëthe Dharma of performing
ones dutyí to be the true Dharma of
every individual. What is called Dharma
by Indian culture, as mentioned earlier,
is referred to quite differently as religion
in the English language. One must realize
that Kartavya Dharma and religion are
totally different things. Just as a
diamond has various facets or angles,
the ëdiamond of Kartavya Dharmaí too
has various facets or aspects. The
various facets of Kartavya Dharma are
oneís duty towards oneís mother, father,
son, daughter, husband, wife, neighbour,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
friend, nation, etc. Religion is nothing
but ëthe duty towards Godí which is just
a single ordinary aspect of this diamond
of Kartavya Dharma. Unfortunately,
however, in reality the various aspects
of Dharma have been neglected and
instead too much emphasis has been
given to religion i.e. ritualistic religion
involving so-called worship of God. The
primary duty or Kartavya Dharma of
every student is to study wholeheartedly
and acquire knowledge. Words are
inadequate to describe the true
importance of knowledge. While money
is no doubt important in Manís life,
knowledge is a thousand times more
important than money. The nation,
whose citizens are illiterate, ignorant
and superstitious, will never be able to
march along the path of progress.
Instead, such a nation will definitely go
down the path of ruin and disaster.
Therefore, Jeevan Vidya reiterates that:
```
```
ìYou must acquire knowledge and wisdom,
You must become clever,
You must all become intelligentî.
```
```
In short, the Kartavya Dharma of every
student is to study wholeheartedly and
```

....................................................................................................................

```
acquire knowledge. Those students who
do not comply with this Kartavya Dharma
will have to repent for their blunder in
future. Instead, those students who
study in accordance with this Kartavya
Dharma will definitely become
successful in their lives.
```
Q. 20 Are educational, social and political

```
organisations useful to students? Should
they take part in their activities?
```
Ans. Most organisations had been founded

```
as a result of the founders being inspired
by some specific noble ideal. However,
it is debatable as to how many
organisations remain faithful to these
noble ideals and work accordingly.
Students should definitely take part in
the activities of organisations that
actively work for the benefit and welfare
of students. However, they and their
parents should take care that under no
circumstances must their studies be
allowed to be adversely affected by their
activities in such organisations.
```
Q. 21 What should a student do if he fails in

the examinations?

Ans. Human life is filled with happiness as

well as sorrow. Whenever events that


....................................................................................................................

```
take place are conducive to welfare of
people, they become happy while if the
events affect welfare adversely, they
become unhappy. In the same way, both
success and failure is a part of life.
Hence, Man must not get bewildered
when faced with adverse circumstances
but instead face them calmly. Every
human being encounters both joy and
sorrow in his life, be he a ordinary person
or a saint or a prophet! About ninety
percent of such events are within the
control of human beings while the
remaining ten percent events are outside
their control. However, common people
are under the erroneous impression
that all the events in human life are
beyond their control. Therefore,
wisdom lies in giving up fatalism and
instead adopting the path of harmonious
thinking. Failing in the examinations is
not a big crime due to which heavens
will fall down on this earth nor is it a
catastrophe as though the sky has fallen
on the head. In Indian mythology, Lord
Shankar is called Mahadev because he
was able to withstand the poison that
he digested at the time of ëAmrit
Manthaní; in the same way, the man
```

....................................................................................................................

```
who can withstand the poison of failure
and take a leap towards the zenith of
success is called a great man. So instead
of becoming sorrowful, because of
failure or blaming and cursing God or
fate or teachers or examiners for oneís
failure, the student should look for the
reasons for his failure. Where there is
effect, these must be a cause too! True
wisdom lies in finding out this cause.
Parents should also provide necessary
assistance to their children to help them
to discover the cause. Students often
do not realise that ëstudying is an artí,
neither do their parents realise this, nor
do most of the teachers realise it.
Therefore, students must learn the art
of studying. Guidance for learning the
art of studying has already been
provided in the answers to questions
asked earlier on this subject.
```
Q. 22 Why should one always speak the

truth? Please guide us on this subject.

Ans. It is generally in our own interest to ëspeak

```
the truthí. Everyone believes a person
who speaks the truth. He commands
credibility in society so that if he is faced
with some monetary or other troubles,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
people readily come forward to help him.
Conversely, no one believes a person who
tell lies. He does not have any credibility
and people are reluctant to help such a
person if he faces some problems.
Secondly, once a person speaks an
untruth, he has to tell a number of lies to
prevent the truth from being revealed.
Despite his best efforts to hide the truth,
it cannot be hidden for long and is
ultimately uncovered to the total
embarrassment of the person. Thirdly, a
person must always discriminate
between when he should speak the truth
or tell an untruth. It is extremely
dangerous to tell the truth to a shrewd
and cunning person or a person willing
to go to any level to achieve his goals or
to people who are traitors to the nation.
In fact, it is better and in everyoneís
interest to tell a lie to such people and
get rid of them. Fourthly, if by speaking
the truth, an individual or a family or
society or the nation are going to be
grievously harmed, on such occasions it
is better to tell a lie and save the
situation. Fifthly, certain events that have
occurred in oneís life and which are
usually supposed to be kept a secret
```

....................................................................................................................

```
should never be revealed to anyone. This
is especially true in instances where a
man and his wife have been married and
where it would be better if certain facts
are kept discreetly hidden; in such
circumstances it would be most
counterproductive to reveal such facts
out of notions like ìIt is a sin to tell liesî
or being carried away by emotions like ìI
find it very disturbing to keep the truth
hiddenî. To sum up, a person should
generally speak the truth and avoid
telling a lie, but when interacting with
some specific type of people or under
special circumstances, he should have
the presence of mind to decide whether
it is better to tell the truth or to hide the
truth.
```
Q. 23 If the house of a student is very small

```
while his family is quite large and as a
result he is unable to study, what
should he do?
```
Ans. It is said that, ìWhere there is a will, there

```
is a way!î If the student is fond of studying
or he is convinced about its importance,
he will definitely find a way to study
without making specious excuses. My
own family was very large and under
```

....................................................................................................................

```
such circumstances I have studied while
sitting on the staircase of the building,
where I was living. There have been many
instances of great people having studied
under the streetlights provided by the
municipal corporations. Many libraries
exist where students can go and study. In
other words, the student who has the
urge to study will definitely find a way
out. Therefore, Jeevan Vidya says:
```
```
ì The master key to a successful life
lies in accepting the circumstances as
they exist and trying to mould them in
the desired and successful way.î
```
Q. 24 Some students are given good sanskars

```
(impressions on the mind) at home, but
the social atmosphere is very polluted
due to undesirable behaviour and
actions of people, corruption, atrocities,
vices, etc. Under such circumstances,
what should students do?
```
Ans. There is beautiful saying in Marathi that,

```
ìIf one is dwelling in water, one should
not antagonize the crocodile living in it!î
As per this saying, one should not live in
society and quarrel with others,
particularly the crooked persons, living
in it. However, not picking up quarrels
```

....................................................................................................................

```
with others does not mean befriending
them. Those students who have received
good sanskars at home will easily be
able to discriminate between what is
good and what is bad or who are good
and who are bad in the world. Under the
circumstances, one should not quarrel
with others but at the same time, cleverly
stay away from undesirable things or
people. One should not do any
undesirable thing for fun or because of
fear of others or under the influence or
coercion of anyone, because, once one
slips while walking along the straight
and narrow path of goodness, it becomes
very difficult to retrieve the situation.
The second important point to remember
is that students should inform their
parents about the prevailing
circumstances in society. Thirdly, students
should always make every effort to be in
the company of other good and decent
students. Besides this, students and their
parents should always remain in touch
with good organisations like Jeevan Vidya
Mission so that they can obtain the
company of good people, so that the
studentís welfare will be enhanced by it.
Fourthly, students and their parents
```

....................................................................................................................

```
should foster a relationship of affection
and friendship among themselves; if this
is not so, students will always remain in
fear of their parents and will not be able
to speak out their minds and reveal the
problems faced by them. Under such
circumstances, it will not take long for a
minor problem to assume grave
proportions. Hence, parents should
establish a rapport with their children
and try and understand their difficulties
and problems so that timely action can
be taken to implement the remedial
measures required - this would be in
everyoneís interest.
```
Q. 25 Some students are asked by their

```
parents to perform pooja or other such
rites and rituals which they do not
like; what should they do?
```
Ans. There exists a gap of one generation

```
between students and their parents.
Because of this generation gap, the new
generation does not agree with the
thoughts of the old generation. Parents
feel that their children should listen to
them and not disobey them. While the
question of whether to perform pooja is
correct or incorrect could be a matter of
```

....................................................................................................................

```
debate, the intention of the parents in
asking their children to perform rites and
rituals is usually good. All parents
wholeheartedly desire that their children
should be benefited and that they should
come up in life. Parents fear that if the
children do not perform rituals as
prescribed by tradition, they will incur
Godís wrath and thus be harmed. If a
student performs rites and rituals to
please his parents the sky will not fall on
his head; at the same time the student
can try and convince his parents that
performing rites and rituals has really no
meaning. Similarly, students can also
explain to their parents the worship taught
by Jeevan Vidya Mission which are an
alternative to rites and rituals. Since the
method is scientific, its significance can
also be explained to parents. In this
context students and their parents must
always remember the fundamental
principle of Jeevan Vidya that:
```
```
ìGod neither blesses or punishes
anybody nor does he interfere or
intervene in any way in Manís life.
Instead, Man alone blesses or curses
himself, by his actions performed at
```

....................................................................................................................

```
the three levels of thought, speech and
deed. The harmonious or harmful
actions that Man directs towards
others come back to him like a
boomerang to bless or curse his life in
accordance with the inescapable laws
of nature.î
```
```
Therefore, it is better to perform good
actions and bring about the welfare and
wellbeing of everyone i.e. oneself, the
family, the society and the nation. To
perform good actions means to-
```
```
ìThink blissfully, wish blessfully, speak
sweetly or pleasantly and perform
actions harmoniously for all.î
```
Q. 26 When examinations draw near,

```
students study very hard which causes
them great strain. Is this the correct
thing to do?
```
Ans. Studying very hard when examinations

```
draw near and thereby straining the
body is the height of foolishness! Most
students fall prey to this only because
they have not understood the importance
of examinations. Students must first of
all understand the reason for holding
examinations. Students know the
```

....................................................................................................................

syllabus in advance and the textbooks

```
are also available. From the viewpoint
of the students it is essential to study
these books well and acquire the
knowledge given therein. Examinations
are held to find out whether students
have studied properly and acquired the
knowledge given in the books. However,
students are usually unaware of this
principal purpose behind holding
examinations or they ignore it. As a
result, students study only at the
eleventh hour when examinations draw
```
```
near. They somehow study something
and in this process, they strain
themselves and somehow just pass in
the examinations. On the other hand,
some students learn everything ëby
heartí without bothering to understand
the meaning and get good marks in the
examinations. These methods of
studying are meaningless from the
viewpoint of the studentsí future, since
neither learning ëby heartí nor getting
good marks will be of much use to them
in their lives. Only the knowledge
acquired by students will stand them in
good stead.
```

....................................................................................................................

Q. 27 Some people are of the opinion that

```
children should not be punished while
others are of the view that students
must always be punished. Please guide
us in this matter.
```
Ans. Unfortunately, the truth is that most

```
students do not adequately understand
the intention behind going to school,
need for teachers, need for education,
significance of studies, education, etc.
Most students believe that they attend
school only because their parents send
them and they have no option but to
obey. From the very beginning, parents
and teachers must give correct guidance
to students, about the importance of
acquiring knowledge and inculcate in
them a love for studies. They must also
use every opportunity to stress upon
the students the harmful and disastrous
effects of avoiding studies. If such
guidance is given to students, the need
for punishing them will never arise!
However, despite such guidance, if the
students persist in mischievous
behaviour and neglect their studies, it
may be necessary to punish them.
However, the punishment should be
beneficial to the students. Like, making
```

....................................................................................................................

```
them hold the thumbs of the feet for
sometime, performing pushups, learning
ëby heartí certain passages from their
text books, etc. However, under no
circumstances must the parents and
teachers beat the students.
```
Q. 28 Frequently, students are unable to

```
understand what the teacher is
teaching. What should students do
under such circumstances?
```
Ans. ëTeachingí is an art and all people cannot

```
be good teachers. Sometimes, highly
qualified teachers may not be able to
teach well. While some lesser-qualified
teachers may be able to teach in an
excellent manner. Therefore, it is
essential that while appointing teachers,
their ability to teach well should be
examined. Secondly, teachers should be
paid good remuneration. It is difficult to
get good teachers for low salaries.
Thirdly, the Principal or headmaster
should carry out surprise inspections to
ensure that teachers are teaching the
students in the appropriate way.
Similarly, the headmaster should also
take the students into confidence and
cleverly find out from the students
```

....................................................................................................................

```
whether their teachers are teaching
them satisfactorily. Finally, the students
themselves should meet the concerned
teacher and humbly explain their
difficulties, so that the teacher can teach
properly in future.
```
Q. 29 After obtaining admission to schools

```
and colleges, it is essential that students
should make friendship with good
students only. Please guide how
students can get good friends?
```
Ans. The future of students depends on the

```
type of friends they make. Even a slight
error could lead to complete disaster in
their lives. In this context, students
should never forget an important
principle of Jeevan Vidya that:
```
```
ìAcquiring company of good students
is very difficult and retaining this
company is even more difficult; but
acquiring company of bad students is
easy and it is also very long-lasting.î
```
```
Therefore, students should be extremely
alert while acquiring company of other
students. It is not very difficult to
recognize good students and bad
students. One can very easily recognize
```

....................................................................................................................

```
whether a student is good or bad by
merely observing his thoughts, speech
and deeds. Students should always
consider all these aspects before
acquiring company of other students.
Once the company of bad students is
acquired, there is grave danger of the
students getting carried away and
ruining their lives in the process. In the
same way, parents should also keep an
eye on their children. Parents should
invite the friends of their children to
their house on some pretext like
celebrating birthdays, etc. and judge
the qualities of the friends from their
speech and behaviour. After examining
other children in this manner, parents
should encourage their children to make
friendship only with good children.
Further, parents should invite other good
students to their house for some reason
or another and help their children to
cement their friendship with other good
students. Besides this, parents should
visit the childrenís school regularly and
meet the teachers and headmaster to
find out about the behavior of their
children in school and learn about their
progress in studies; this is very essential
```

....................................................................................................................

```
for ensuring the welfare of children.
When children realize that their parents
visit school frequently and inquire about
them, they will not dare to go astray,
fearing that they will get caught. In
other words, students must always be
very careful of the company they keep,
since ëthe company of other studentsí
has the tremendous power to either
bring about their improvement or to
bring about their complete ruin. Hence,
it is one of the main duties of parents to
take care that their children get the
company of other good students only.
```
Q. 30If the parents of students perform

```
undesirable actions like drinking
liquor, smoking cigarettes, eating gutka
(chewing tobacco), quarrelling with
neighbours, getting into fights and
scuffles, etc., then why should the
students consider them as equivalent
to God?
```
Ans. Howsoever the parents may be, still the

```
children are indebted to them for many
things. Parents give birth to children,
bring them up, look after them, give
them nutritious food, education, etc.
Students should take into account this
```

....................................................................................................................

```
debt that they owe to their parents and
try to consider them equivalent to God.
On waking up, the first thing that
children should do is to prostrate
themselves at the feet of their parents.
In the same way, they should pray to
God to grant everyone (which includes
the parents of the student, too), good
thoughts. The Universal Prayer of Jeevan
Vidya should be recited in such a manner
that everyone in the house can hear it.
There exist numerous instances of
parents, who were earlier indulging in
undesirable habits, but were
transformed simply by hearing the
Universal prayer regularly.
```
Q. 31 Frequently the teachers in schools are

```
themselves addicted to cigarettes,
alcohol, gutka, etc. Under such
circumstances, how can the students
have any respect for them?
```
Ans. Though the teacher may be a victim of

```
addiction, still, as long as the student
goes to school and learns from him, the
student should look upon him in the
sacred role of a ëteacherí and consider
him as equivalent to God and respect
him. Students should consider the
```

....................................................................................................................

```
important fact that the teacher teaches
them and try to look upon him with the
feeling that he is as good as ëGodí.
Students should do this as a matter of
duty. If the students look at the teacher
with this innocent and sacred viewpoint,
it is probable that the teacher himself
will be transformed. Once the students
start looking upon the teacher with the
feeling that he is ëa God who imparts
knowledgeí, these holy emotions are
radiated towards the teacher in the form
of positive vibrations, and they definitely
have a salutary effect on the teacher
and it is possible to bring about his
transformation for the better in this
manner. Besides this, students should
pray to God to grant their teachers the
wisdom to give up their undesirable
vices. If students collectively recite the
Universal Prayer of Jeevan Vidya it will
benefit everyone. Secondly, teachers
should also behave in a responsible
manner. Should teachers not realize that
if they themselves do undesirable things
or are addicted to vices, then what
would be the terrible impact of this on
the students? The children of today are
the citizens of tomorrow and if they are
```

....................................................................................................................

```
spoiled and ruined, what will be the
terrible consequences and harm that
would befall the nation? Who can
understand this better than teachers? If
the house in which we live collapses,
then the destruction and complete ruin
of all the inmates is inevitable. In the
same way, if students are spoiled and
ruined, the nation will be in grave danger
and everyone will be totally devastated.
Teachers should take this into account
and behave with a sense of
responsibility. For their own welfare, and
for the welfare of the society and the
nation, teachers should keep themselves
away from bad habits and give
appropriate guidance to the students.
```
Q. 32 What exactly should students do to

```
remain relevant in the competitive
world of today?
```
Ans. It is not true to say that only the world

```
of today is very competitive and it was
not so in earlier days. Today, the
competition has become very severe
due to the tremendous increase in
population. To remain relevant in todayís
competitive world, students should
always remember the following
```

....................................................................................................................

principles of Jeevan Vidya:

1) You are the architect of your destiny;

```
2) Efforts have the potential or capacity
to achieve everything including ëGod-
realizationí and, therefore, efforts
may be compared to a jewel which
is even greater than God;
```
```
3) To be reluctant to study is to turn
your back on good-luck;
```
```
4) Everyone wants a person who is
knowledgeable and useful and he
can withstand any competition.
Therefore Jeevan Vidya says:
```
```
ìYou must all become knowledgeable,
You must all become clever,
You must all become intelligentî.
```
Q. 33 While studying in school, how can

```
students decide in advance as to what
they will become in future? What
efforts should they make to reach the
selected goal?
```
Ans. Every student is born with some special

```
talent. However, most students are not
aware of this truth. The talents inherent
in the student are manifested in the
form of ëlikingí for something. Frequently,
these talents are accidentally revealed
```

....................................................................................................................

```
due to circumstances. Therefore, in
consultation with their parents, students
should decide what they would like to
become after taking into account their
liking as well as their talents. Under no
circumstances should the parent force
the student to become something
against his wishes. All occupations that
are useful to society are equally good;
no occupation is superior to another.
Whatever the occupation selected by
the student, he should do it
wholeheartedly and strive to become
the best in the field and reach the top.
There also exist certain career
counseling organisations or vocational
guidance centres which guide the
student to select the appropriate field
after taking into account factors like his
liking for some occupation, the scope
for various occupations, etc. These
institutions also help the student by
advising him about how to plan for the
courses, how to prepare for them, etc.
Some organisations also conduct
exhibitions on this subject and also give
detailed information about various
occupations. Since complete information
is available at one place in these
```

....................................................................................................................

```
institutions, it becomes easier for
students to take into account their liking
and decide on which field to select.
Similarly, some business and
employment magazines and books are
available which give detailed information
on this subject. All these things are
useful to the student for deciding the
field of business or occupation in future
and making preparations well in advance
for achieving the same.
```
Q. 34 We are living in the era of fashion; is

fashion desirable for students or not?

Ans. Whether to adopt fashion or not is for

```
every student to decide based on his
liking. It is not as though fashion is bad
by itself. If a student likes fashion, he
can indulge in it to some extent.
However, students should ensure that
they do not get carried away by ëfashioní
and in the process ëruiní their parents.
There is no harm in students indulging
in fashion in a limited way, taking care
at the same time that their parents can
afford it and they are not troubled in
any way. Students could take recourse
to fashion for looking smart and be well
dressed. However, under no circums-
```

....................................................................................................................

```
tances should students indulge in too
much fashion for the purpose of
impressing others, especially girls, or
for competing with other students. In
doing so, it is likely that the students
will harm themselves as well as their
parents. Secondly, students should not
neglect studies in their love of fashion.
Thirdly, being fashionable is not such a
great thing; it only indicates superficiality
in a person. Those people who are
astute and wise prefer students who
indulge in ësimple living and high
thinkingí to those who indulge in fashion.
```
Q. 35 What should students do if they are

```
discriminated by teachers and others
on grounds of religion, caste, tribe,
region, etc?
```
Ans. From the viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya,

```
discrimination on grounds of factors like
religion, clan, caste, tribe, sect, region,
etc. should never be tolerated under
any circumstances or for any reason or
under any other excuse. To discriminate
among human beings and to commit
injustice and atrocities on any human
being is a very grave crime in the court
of God. Therefore, it would be extremely
```

....................................................................................................................

```
wrong for teachers or anyone else for
that matter, to discriminate against
others in the name of religion, caste,
etc. If teachers themselves start
indulging in such undesirable behaviour,
it would create wrong sanskars
(impression) on the students and no one
should be surprised if the grave
consequences of these actions are borne
by the students, the society and the
nation in the years to come. It is the
crystal clear viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya
that in the interest of the welfare of
students and the all-round progress of
the nation, there should never be any
discrimination in the name of religion,
caste, etc. But if such discrimination does
occur, the students concerned must first
of all meet the teacher and complain to
the teacher in all humility and, if
necessary, then meet the headmaster
or principal and complain to him.
```
Q. 36 Should students indulge in ragging?

```
How should victims of ragging protect
themselves?
```
Ans. Ragging is an extremely disgusting,

```
ignoble and terrible thing. It is a blot on
student world. All the people concerned
```

....................................................................................................................

```
should ensure that under no
circumstances should instances of
ragging ever occur. Ragging is not an
act, which brings glory to anyone;
instead it is a horrible act and is an
indicator of a perverted psyche. Many
students had to face terrible hardships
and harm due to ragging. Some students
have dropped out of college due to
ragging while others have even
committed suicide because of it. The
parents of students should always be
very alert about ragging. Parents should
regularly inquire and ensure that their
children are not being ragged. Even
after such alertness, if some instance of
ragging does occur, the students and
their parents should rush to the college
principal and the police and duly make
a written complaint against the students
who have indulged in ragging; legal
action will automatically be started
against the students who indulge in
ragging. However, under no
circumstances should the students and
their parents remain silent and allow
themselves to become victims of ragging
due to fear. There is a beautiful saying
in Marathi that, ìIf I call a tiger by his
```

....................................................................................................................

```
name he will eat me up, and even if I
call him Lord Tiger, he will still eat me
up!î In the same way, if the students
complain to the police against the
students who indulge in ragging they
will have to face harassment and even if
they donít complain they will have to
face harassment in the form of ragging.
Under these circumstances, it would be
better to complain against the students
who indulge in ragging. In case there
are undesirable instances of students
committing suicide or students leaving
college or students getting physical
injuries, etc., it would be possible for
the police to take action against students
who have indulged in ragging. At the
same time, in the interest of welfare of
students, Principals and professors of
colleges should also keep in touch with
the students and take them into
confidence to find out whether ragging
is indeed taking place in the college.
```
Q. 37 As per the rules of hostels, three

```
students have to share one room. If
the other two students are bad or
addicted, they may force a good
student to become addicted to vices.
What should the good students do
```

....................................................................................................................

under such circumstances?

Ans. Under such circumstances, students

```
should immediately contact their parents
and make them aware of the grave
situation that exists in the hostel. Parents
in turn must immediately contact the
principal of the college and get the room
of the student changed. Under no
circumstances should the students fall
prey to fear and remain silent about
such circumstances. In the same way, it
is essential that the principal and the
rector of the hostel should contact the
students who indulge in vices and take
them into confidence and give them
proper guidance. Further, the principal
should contact the parents of students
who indulge in vices and alert them to
the bad behaviour and addiction to vices
of the students.
```
Q. 38 Some students who study in colleges

```
indulge in vices like drinking, smoking,
eating gutka, etc. in the name of
enjoyment. Such students, who are
addicted to vices, make fun of students
who do not indulge in vices; what
should good students do under such
circumstances?
```

....................................................................................................................

Ans. The main reason why students become

```
addicted to vices is that they do not
receive correct guidance at the
appropriate time from their parents and
teachers. Jeevan Vidya emphasizes that:
```
```
ìIf students are given timely and
proper guidance, they will never
become victims of addictions or vices.î
```
```
Therefore, parents must ensure that
children who are addicted to vices get
proper guidance by any means available
to them. An invaluable principle of
Jeevan Vidya states that:
```
```
ìThe human body is a living idol of
God or a living divine computer and
the body will give desirable or
undesirable results, as per the
Universal Laws of Nature, depending
on the good or bad inputs in the form
of actions given to it.î
```
```
If this important principle is properly
explained to students and the terrible
consequences of vices and addictions
are brought out, then no student will
dare to become addicted to vices. To
indulge in vices is like acquiring terrible
and horrible troubles and it is an
```

....................................................................................................................

```
invitation to oneís own destruction and
doom. If this truth is impressed upon
students, they will definitely not fall a
prey to vices. Whatever be the
circumstances, students should not come
under the evil influence of addicted
children. Parents should make every
effort to impart correct guidance to such
children through the medium of
discourses and books. In this manner,
everyone will be benefited.
```
Q. 39 Is it proper for students of schools and

colleges to fall in love?

Ans. Firstly, students should remember that

```
their parents send them to schools and
colleges so that they study and not for
falling in love! Those who stray from the
path of Kartavya Dharma i.e. ëthe Dharma
of performing ones dutyí will always
have to repent in years to come. The
Kartavya Dharma of a student is to study
and to get education. To neglect this
Kartavya Dharma and instead indulge in
love affairs is to invite troubles for
oneself. Parents and teachers have great
expectations from their children, who
study in schools and colleges. Most
parents cannot afford to educate their
```

....................................................................................................................

```
children. They have to make great
financial sacrifices for sending their
children to schools and colleges,
sometimes, even taking a loan for this
purpose. Parents expect that their
children will learn well, acquire excellent
knowledge, select an appropriate
occupation in future, become excellent
citizens and take their nation along the
path of progress. But instead of
studying, if students indulge in love
affairs it would mean that they are
fooling themselves, their parents, their
teachers, and even God. It is obvious
that such cheating is a great crime and
every criminal automatically faces
punishment by the Universal Laws of
Nature.
```
```
Secondly, ëloveí is a splendid and
exceptional emotion and such people
who genuinely love others are
themselves very wonderful and
exceptional. Such exceptional people
are rarely found. Such a true love
involves sacrifice and not enjoyment and
the exceptional people who possess this
exceptional love are ever ready to
sacrifice everything that they possess
for the happiness of each other. If the
```

....................................................................................................................

```
love of such exceptional people is not
successful, their only wish is that the
person whom they love should always
dwell in peace and happiness, wherever
he or she may be. Such exceptional
people do not have attraction for the
body but love the qualities of the person
with whom they are in love.
```
```
However, in actual practice what one
observes in the case of people who
claim to be in love is just the opposite!
Students become victims of infatuation
as a result of sexual attraction of the
body and fool themselves and others
into believing that they are really in love;
this so-called love becomes a sure recipe
for disaster in life. Since this so-called
love is merely infatuation due to sexual
attraction, it is rooted in craving for
ëenjoymentí and there exists not even a
trace of sacrifice in it! Instead, if due to
some reason, this so-called love affair is
not successful, these ëloversí do not
hesitate to even go to the extent of
killing each other! In the same way,
before a love-marriage, the lovers
serenade each other, court each other
and make all sorts of vows and promises
```

....................................................................................................................

```
to each other of undying love. They
valiantly proclaim, ìI cannot live without
youî, etc. during the course of the love
affair or before the love-marriage. Since
such couples are adept at quoting
dialogues from films, it is not surprising
that young boys and girls become
victims of their own make-believe world.
The love-talk and vows taken before
marriage are so absurd and unrealistic
that within six months of marriage, their
marriage is on the rocks and within two
years of the marriage these lovers may
get divorced. In short, wise students
should realise that it is not in their own
interest to get involved in love affairs;
such distractions are likely to mar their
future prospects.
```
```
In this context, it is essential to clarify
an important point. There is a world of
a difference between ëloveí and ëlove
affairsí. It requires wisdom to love but
even a foolish person can indulge in
ëlove affairsí. Considering the age of
students in schools and colleges, it may
be said that they are immature in all
respects. They do not even know the
meaning of true love. Due to their tender
```

....................................................................................................................

```
age, childish thoughts and actions, it
should not surprise anyone if students
indulging in such activities ruin their
lives. Students generally fall in love on
the basis of superficial things like beauty
of the body, wealth, money, proficiency
in games like cricket, tennis, etc. or false
assurances and showy, stylish and
fashionable appearance. The phrase ëto
fall in loveí is significant in this context.
Those who fall into the pit of ëloveí are
never able to get up again. During the
period of the love affair, lovers feel that
they are literally floating in the air.
However, after marriage, their feet touch
the ground and the thorns and pebbles
lying all round start hurting them, with
a result that they wake up to ground
reality! The principal reason for this turn
of events is that all the superficial
attributes narrated above do not have
the capacity to make human life happy
or successful. It is said that, ìLove is
blindî. However, in reality love is not
blind but the intelligence of lovers
becomes ëblindí. It is commonly
observed that 99% of all love affairs and
love-marriages are unsuccessful since
the ëloversí have forgotten that,
```

....................................................................................................................

```
ìAppearances are deceptiveî. However,
only 1% of the love affairs and love-
marriages are successful because the
lovers possess ëwisdomí. Such ëwisdomí
lies in taking into account qualities such
as good human nature, pleasing
behaviour, good education, excellent
teachings and ësanskarsí (latent
impressions on the mind), adjusting
nature, freedom from vices, economic
independence and vocational
competence. When love is showered
based on these qualities, such couples
become happy and successful.
In short, students must always
remember that, ìLife is not a bed of
rosesî. At the same time, to ensure
that, life does not become a ëbed of
thornsí and they do not face bitter
experiences in future, students should
accept the ground reality or
circumstances as they exist and stride
along the path of wisdom so that they
can soar like an eagle to the pinnacles
of success in life.
```
Q. 40 Students have to study a number of

```
subjects. While, they enjoy some of
these, they hate some other subjects.
Why is this so?
```

....................................................................................................................

Ans. Our life revolves around the mind.

```
Sometimes the mind is favourable to us
and at other times it is adverse. The
boat of our life sways from side to side
depending on the favourable condition
or unfavourable condition of our mind.
We like some subjects because our mind
takes interest in them. Similarly, those
subjects which are easily grasped or
understood by the mind are liked by it.
The mind likes to study only those
subjects from which it derives joy.
Conversely, some subjects are not
grasped by the intellect due to which
the mind does not like these subjects
and tries to avoid them. So the tendency
of the student is towards neglecting the
study of such subjects or not studying
them adequately. As a result, students
either fail or get less marks in such
subjects. Students are often unable to
find a way out of this problem. Jeevan
Vidya provides excellent guidance to
students in this topic. A vicious cycle is
formed here; since the student does not
study the subject, his intellect cannot
understand it and since the intellect
does not understand the subject the
student does not like it. This vicious
```

....................................................................................................................

```
cycle has to be broken by the students
themselves. If students study as per the
3R formula laid down by Jeevan Vidya,
they will start understanding the
subjects better and better and as they
start understanding the subject well,
their mind will start taking interest in
the subject so that they will start liking
it. Secondly, it would be beneficial for
students to seek proper guidance from
the right people for subjects that they
do not like. This guidance could be
obtained from clever students in class
or from teachers or parents. If proper
and timely guidance is obtained,
students will start understanding the
subjects and gradually liking them.
Thirdly, students must always remember
the important fact that there is no escape
from studying all subjects and getting
good marks in them. Studying involves
reading of the subjects again and again.
They should also remember that nothing
is impossible if one is only willing to
study. If one studies with the intention
of acquiring knowledge, one gradually
starts liking even those subjects that
one does not like at first. In other words,
students should always remember the
```

....................................................................................................................

important principle of Jeevan Vidya that,

```
ìIf you avoid studies, a bright
future will evade youî.
```
Q. 41 Jeevan Vidya proclaims that, ìYou are

```
the Architect of Your destinyî; what is
luck then and how does it occur?
```
Ans. There exist tremendous misund-

```
erstandings and erroneous notions
about the concepts of destiny (Niyati)
and luck. Manís destiny does not shower
on him from the heavens nor does it
grow in the soil. While living, Man
performs actions continuously on the
three levels of thought, speech and deed.
There exists an intimate relationship
```
```
between the Universal Laws of Nature
and Manís actions. When Man acts, he
sets into motion the Universal Laws of
Nature; which, in turn activate what is
termed as Niyati or destiny. When this
Niyati manifests in Manís life, he
experiences it in the form of happiness
or sorrow. For understanding this
important topic in detail, I recommend
that you refer my other book ëYou are
```
the architect of your destinyí.


....................................................................................................................

Q. 42 Can students show progress in their

```
studies by reciting the Universal
prayer?
```
Ans. The Universal Prayer of Jeevan Vidya is

given below:

ëO God,

```
Bless all with health and wealth,
Bless all with money and harmony,
Bless all with peace and happiness,
Bless all with wisdom and your devotioní
By reciting the Universal Prayer, Man
can progress in studies as well as make
all-round progress in his life. Students
should not neglect their studies to recite
the Universal Prayer. However, the spare
time which is available in between the
studies, should be used to recite the
Universal Prayer. Similarly, after
completing their studies and just before
going to bed, students should recite the
Universal prayer. By doing so, it will give
stability and peace to the conscious
mind; while the sub-conscious mind will
absorb the studies already done during
the day. Once the knowledge is
absorbed in the sub-conscious mind, it
is easily available to the conscious mind,
which can reproduce it accurately in
```

....................................................................................................................

```
examinations. This helps the student to
get success.
```
Q. 43 In society, we observe that well-

```
educated graduates are unable to get
jobs; while, people without any
education get into politics and
accumulate huge wealth using illegal
methods. Given such circumstances, it
becomes difficult for students to
understand what they should do?
Please guide us on this topic.
```
Ans. The fundamental reason for the

```
occurrence of all troubles and
undesirable things is only one and that
is the tremendous increase in population
which is also aptly referred to as the
ëpopulation explosioní. There are more
graduate applicants for jobs than
available vacancies. Obviously, it would
not be possible for all the applicants to
get jobs. This problem has become more
acute because of technological advances
like automation of jobs which were being
done manually as well as the advent of
computers. With the help of computers,
one can do excellent work in lesser time
and with lesser people than could be
done previously. This has contributed to
```

....................................................................................................................

```
unemployment, especially of unskilled
labour but technological changes have
created jobs for educated and
specialised people who have undergone
this training. Therefore, graduates
should not hanker after jobs but instead
look out for opportunities to set up some
independent business. If even illiterate
people can set up independent business
and gain a lot of wealth, there is no
reason why a graduate cannot do so.
```
```
Secondly, as a result of inability to get
jobs, young men become frustrated and,
in this frame of mind, they may be
provoked to go to any extent and do
undesirable things which they may not
under normal circumstances do. The
underworld takes full advantage of this
situation. Under the guise of giving jobs,
they encourage young men to do
undesirable and illegal things. Once
some crime has occurred, these young
men have no other option but to do
whatever the underworld dictates to
them. Just as a person who enters the
tigerís den cannot come out alive,
similarly once these young men become
victims of the underworld, they are
```

....................................................................................................................

```
forever trapped in it. Under such
circumstances, it is no use repenting
since nothing can be done about it.
```
```
Students should always remember that
though some people, whether
uneducated or otherwise, do evil things
and accumulate huge wealth and indulge
in conspicuous consumption, they can
never become happy. People who
perform evil (illegal) deeds and earn
black money are actually criminals. But
till their crime is proved, they continue
to live in society with their heads held
high. These criminals can never attain
peace, happiness or satisfaction.
Instead, such people lead their lives
under terrible tensions. Leading such a
life is like dying a thousand deaths. The
evil deeds of such people will definitely
boomerang on them, today or tomorrow,
by the Universal Laws of Nature. They
have to face wretched circumstances in
their lives like physical and mental
diseases, dangers, problems,
catastrophes, troubles, misery, sorrow,
etc., and their children are also likely to
become addicted to undesirable things.
Money and wealth which is accumulated
```

....................................................................................................................

```
by undesirable and corrupt means is
cursed. Not only does it bring trouble to
the person who has accumulated it, but
it is also responsible for bringing terrible
harm, sorrow and misery to his children
and future generations in accordance
with the law of inheritance and the
Universal Laws of Nature. Students
should take all these things into account
and should always remain away from
wicked people; this is in their own
interest as well as in the interest of the
nation.
```
```
Fourthly, students should not give undue
importance to earning money. Anyone
can accumulate wealth. Even thieves,
dacoits, terrorists, prostitutes, black-
marketers, etc. accumulate money
through undesirable means and spend
it on wasteful expenditure and
conspicuous consumption. However, as
mentioned earlier, such people can never
become happy. Even if God were to
appear on earth for this purpose, he
would not be able to make them happy.
Persons who accumulate wealth by
cheating others, robbing others or
causing misery to others, can never
```

....................................................................................................................

```
become happy. People generally believe
that money is Lakshmi (the Goddess of
wealth). However, this is not the
complete truth. Wealth earned through
undesirable means is nothing but an
incarnation of ëKadak-Lakshmií (the
malevolent form of Lakshmi) while
wealth earned by good means is actually
Maha-Lakshmi (the benevolent form of
Goddess Lakshmi). Kadak-Lakshmi is
responsible for creating all sorts of
troubles, problems, miseries and chaos
in human life; while Maha-Lakshmi
blesses Man with happiness, peace,
success and prosperity in life.
Just as Man begets Man, while a tiger
begets a tiger, in accordance with the
Universal Laws of Nature, similarly
sorrow begets sorrow and happiness
begets happiness. Hence, whatsoever
happiness or sorrow that Man gives to
others comes back to him like a
boomerang, magnified and multiplied,
to bless or curse his life. Students should
always remember that people who
indulge in ëenjoymentí and waste their
lives in it have to ultimately face a
miserable and bleak future. Further,
those people who accumulate wealth
```

....................................................................................................................

```
and money through black (evil) means
create grave dangers to the economic
system of the nation. Thus, such people
are traitors and criminals in the eyes of
society and are enemies of the nation in
which they live.
```
Q. 44 Some students copy in examinations

```
and pass. Could you please guide us on
this subject?
```
Ans. Copying itself is a crime and a criminal

```
will automatically have to face
punishment either by law or by the
Universal Laws of Nature. If a criminal is
somehow able to escape from the
clutches of the law, he will have to face
punishment in accordance with the
Universal Laws of Nature.
```
```
Secondly, when a student passes the
examinations by resorting to copying,
he is fooling himself, his parents, his
teachers and God. It is possible to pass
examinations without studying, but it is
not possible to acquire knowledge in
this way. If a student does not acquire
knowledge by studying, then in future
he will not be of any use to anyone,
wherever he may choose to go. It will
not be surprising if such a useless
```

....................................................................................................................

```
person faces a hopeless and bleak
future.
```
```
Thirdly, if a student is lazy and tries to
avoid studying in schools and colleges
and neglects studies, he may be
temporarily able to save himself from
hard work. Nevertheless, in his future
life, he is likely to face great difficulties
and troubles since he has not acquired
knowledge through education. In other
words, it is not possible for a person to
avoid making efforts in life. If efforts are
not made to study in schools and
colleges, he will be forced to perform all
sorts of hard tasks involving great efforts
in his future life.
```
```
Fourthly, studying does not really require
too much effort. Instead, if the mind is
kept stable and still and the student
studies with the objective of acquiring
knowledge, he will start liking studies.
In short, instead of copying in
examinations and fooling oneself as well
as others, it would be in the best
interests of students to study and attain
success in life.
```
Q. 45 Some students are jealous and envious

of others. Does this retard the growth


....................................................................................................................

```
of students? Could you please guide
such students in the matter?
```
Ans. It is foolish for students to be jealous

```
and envious of others. By being jealous
and envious of others, such students
are likely to radiate negative and
poisonous thought vibrations into the
environment. If we touch coal, we will
be defiled or blackened. In the same
way, jealous and envious thoughts
poison the relationship between
students. No one benefits from such
thoughts; instead, the students
themselves are likely to be harmed as a
result.
```
```
Secondly, students should remember that
the human body is like a computer. If you
feed the computer with wrong or correct
inputs then it will give you corresponding
wrong or correct results. So, when a
student harbours negative emotions of
jealousy, he feeds his own computer with
harmful emotions. Simultaneously, he
feeds these harmful emotions in the
computers of others. Therefore, he and
others are greatly harmed by this wrong
feeding to human computer, because the
output from the computer will also be
```

....................................................................................................................

```
harmful. In this context the following
thoughts of Dr. Murphy should always be
kept in mind by students:
```
```
ìThoughts of jealousy, fear, worry and
anxiety tear down your nerves and
glands bringing about physical and
mental diseases of all kinds.î
```
```
Instead of being jealous of others and
harming themselves and others, it is, in
the best interests of students to
cooperate with each other and help each
other so as to bring about the welfare
of all people concerned.
```
Q. 46 The social environment is full of

```
corrupt practices, atrocities and wrong
behaviour; under such circumstances
students are unable to decide as to
who their role model should be. Could
you kindly guide us in this context?
```
Ans. During cold weather, we wear warm

```
clothes to protect ourselves from the
cold. Similarly, even though there exists
corruption, injustice and wrong
behaviour all around us, we must protect
ourselves from their influence with the
help of the good sanskars (subtle
impressions on the mind) that we
```

```
imbibe. It is wrong to believe that these
undesirable things are occurring only in
todayís world. In fact, such undesirable
things have been occurring since time
immemorial. The main reason why these
undesirable things occur is due to the
evil of ëthought pollutioní. The whole of
the human race is mired in the
ëquicksandí of ignorance. This ignorance
gives rise to undesirable things like ego,
superstitions, false pride, erroneous
thoughts, jealousy, envy and
dissatisfaction. These in turn give rise
to the terrible demon of thought
pollution who creates undesirable things
like corruption, bad behaviour, atrocities,
rape, feuds, riots, battles, wars, etc. in
Manís life. Jeevan Vidya has been created
with the intention of curbing thought
pollution. In my view,
```
```
ìJeevan Vidya is the only solution for
this thought pollutionî
```
```
Students must avail of the facilities and
benefits provided by Jeevan Vidya and
protect themselves from above
mentioned undesirable things. To
conclude, our country has given birth to
many eminent, brave and great men
```

....................................................................................................................

```
and women since ancient times; students
should use them as role models.
```
Q. 47 In your opinion, is it proper for

```
students to worship God? Please guide
us on this subject.
```
Ans. Barring a few intelligent exceptions, the

```
traditional method of worshiping God,
is based on performing rites and rituals.
Jeevan Vidya, however, does not
approve of performing rites and rituals.
Therefore it does not approve of
ritualistic methods of worshiping God.
From the viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya, the
supreme worship of God for students is
to attend schools and colleges and
obtain ëgood educationí. The schools and
colleges are temples of learning, the
teacher is the God in these temples, the
students are the worshippers there and
studying wholeheartedly for acquiring
knowledge is the worship of God. By
studying in this way, with the intention
of acquiring knowledge, students please
God in the form of the teacher, give
satisfaction to their parents and they
themselves obtain the capability of
being able to serve the society and the
nation, in an excellent way, in future.
```

....................................................................................................................

Students should always remember that :

ìKnowledge is Godî

```
Students who study well and acquire
knowledge become excellent citizens of
the nation in future and are responsible
for taking their nation to such great
heights that the nation surpasses all
other nations in every way. At the same
time, Jeevan Vidya further defines
worship as doing all that is necessary
to keep the body in good health,
making the mind stable and quiet and
bringing about the development of the
intellect. In Marathi and Sanskrit
language, the word for worship is
ëUpasanaí. ëUpaí means near or close to
and ëAsanaí means to be seated. Thus
worship involves being very close to
God.
```
```
Another method of worshipping God is
to be happy and to make others happy.
This is possible because our inherent
nature is bliss (swanand). Similarly, the
indwelling God in us is also called as
ëanandaí, which means bliss. He is also
called ëGovindaí, which means bliss
flowing through us. Similarly, we
experience happiness when we are
```

....................................................................................................................

```
healthy by doing exercises or yoga-
asanas. In fact, no happiness is
comparable to that of being healthy. So,
by constantly thinking positive and
auspicious thoughts and remembering
God i.e. thinking blessfully, the mind
attains stability. By speaking pleasantly
and performing harmonious and good
actions, the mind attains peace and by
studying in the correct way, the intellect
is developed.
```
```
In short, studying is an indivisible part
of worship. Therefore, students should
perform the worship prescribed by
Jeevan Vidya and bring about their own
welfare as also the welfare of the society
and the nation in which they live.
```
Q. 48 What should be the attitude of students

```
towards teachers and vice versa?
Please guide us on this subject.
```
Ans. ìEvery action has an equal and opposite

```
reactioní is one of the principal Laws of
Nature. Man should lead his life taking
into account this inevitable Law of
Nature. The attitude of students
towards the teachers and vice versa
will determine the results that they
get; thus if they behave in a positive
```

....................................................................................................................

```
way towards one another they will get
desirable results; if they behave in
negative way they will get undesirable
results. Teachers should always
remember the truth that the students
of today are the citizens of tomorrow.
The progress of the country depends
on these students. In other words, we
will all be benefited if students become
good citizens and we will all suffer if
they become bad. Keeping this fact in
mind, teachers should always sincerely
endeavour to give students correct
education. In the same way, students
should remember the truth that the
knowledge they acquire from the
teachers will be useful to them in future
and will help them to make their life
successful. Students should therefore
sincerely respect and honour their
teachers.
```
Q. 49 There exists a lot of confusion among

```
students about the twin concepts of
sin (papa) and spiritual merit or virtue
(punya). Please guide us on this topic.
```
Ans. Some people are of the opinion that the

```
twin concepts of papa and punya are
merely superstitions. However, this point
```

....................................................................................................................

```
of view of thought is totally wrong since
it is based on ignorance. Nevertheless,
it is true that there exists many
erroneous concepts about what
constitutes papa and punya among the
populace. Similarly, a large number of
people consider a number of things to
be punya while these are in fact papa
and vice versa.
The concept of papa and punya as
enunciated by Jeevan Vidya philosophy
is totally different from the traditional
views. Man is a social animal and he is
deeply indebted to society in a number
of ways. It is every Manís duty to repay
his debt to society. Whatever good or
bad actions are performed by Man on
the three levels of thoughts, words and
deeds have a corresponding desirable
or undesirable impact on society.
Conversely, whatever bad or good
incidents or events that occur in society
have a corresponding desirable or
undesirable effect on Man. Man must
take this truth into account and always
ensure that his actions will result only in
the welfare of the society at large. All
such actions are designated by Jeevan
Vidya as Punya. Conversely, if Manís
```

....................................................................................................................

```
actions harm him, as well as the society,
such actions are termed as papa.
```
```
In short, bad or good actions create
ëpapaí or ëpunyaí and when these papa
and punya mature, they create
inauspicious or auspicious ëniyatií which
becomes responsible for bestowing
sorrow or happiness in Manís life.
```
Q. 50 Who can be called an excellent citizen

```
from the viewpoint of Jeevan Vidya?

progress of the nation lies his own
progress and in the ruin of his nation

Defence of the Nation, and Duty to

```
```
4) He who acquires knowledge in

```
```

undesirable means like corruption,
evil means, atrocities, etc. is an
excellent citizen of the nation.
```
```

own nestí or for furthering his own
selfish interests but instead uses it
only for bringing about the welfare,
benefit and well-being of the people
and for the progress of the nation is
an excellent citizen of the nation.
```

....................................................................................................................

```
8) He who does not give importance to
man-made artificial divisions and
barriers of religion, colour, caste, clan,
tribe, sect, region, language, etc. but
instead holds the sincere opinion that
ëWe are all the citizens of the Nation
and are all equal in every wayí is an
excellent citizen of the nation.
```
```
9) He who leads his life with the firm
conviction that his every ëthought-
word-deedí should be for the welfare
and benefit and well-being of the
nation is an excellent citizen of the
nation.
```
```
I pray to God Almighty that every
student should become an excellent
citizen of the nation.
